                If customer query is about stop loss order not getting executed, Think step-by-step to answer this query
                <thinking>
                1. Use the get order details tool to get details of the stop loss order
                2. If order status is complete, then we can just tell the user that this order was successfully executed.
                3. If the order status is cancelled and has trigger price, then stop order was trigger and it got cancelled later on.
                4. If cancellation reason is cancelled_by_user, that means user closed the position manually or cancelled the stop order before the stop order could get executed.
                5. If cancellation reason is position_liquidated, that means position was liquidated before order got filled, hence the stop order got cancelled
                </thinking>

                <answer>
                1. Start with informing user whether the stop order was triggered or not, and what was the trigger price when it got triggered.
                2. If position was liquidated, specifically mention that the users need to set a stop loss order which is better than the liquidation price of the position. Tell the user he can check the traded price chart to verify if his stop limit price was never reached.
