Time-In-Force Orders,"Time-In-Force orders refer to order instructions which indicate how long an open order will remain active for before it expires. This provides traders with an additional measure of control when opening active positions.

There are 2 available Time-in-Force orders available on
Delta Exchange
- GTC & IOC.
GTC
- GTC, or Good-Till-Cancelled, ensures that the order remains active until cancellation by the trader. When using this order type, an order will either execute or be manually canceled by the trader.
IOC
- IOC, or Immediate-Or-Cancel, ensures that any unfilled parts of an order are canceled immediately if not filled. IOC orders will as large a part of an order as possible, canceling the rest immediately.
Time-In-Force orders are a powerful tool for traders to improve control over the timing and execution of their orders on Delta.

Reduce-Only Orders,"Reduce-only orders allow traders to execute buy or sell orders which only reduce a current position, as opposed to opening an opposite long or short worth more than the existing value of your assets,
letting you trade without the risk of over-exposing your positions.
Orders marked as ""reduce-only"" will be canceled if they would result in increasing the position size in the opposite direction. Whilst the reduce-only flag can be used with any order type, it is most useful when combined with stop orders.

Trailing-Stop Orders,"Trailing-stop orders are an order type that activates once/if the market price goes against you by a set amount, referred to as the Trail Amount, providing you with added flexibility and automation. The stop price follows the market at a fixed distance if the price is moving in favor of your order. The stop price remains unchanged when the market is moving against the trader, however, protecting against potential losses. This enables a trader to specify a limit on the maximum possible loss (the trail amount), without having to set a limit on the maximum possible gain. When the market reaches the trigger price, a market order is activated.
Example
: If a trader is in a long position and the current price is 500, a trader can open trailing-stop orders with a price distance of 20. This will create a sell stop order at 480. Contrary to a normal stop order, if the price continues to rise to 550, the trailing stop rises accordingly to 530. If the price falls to 530, a market order is activated.

Post-Only Orders,"Post-Only orders are a limit order type on
Delta
which is only accepted if it does not immediately match with an existing order in the book. In line with this, a Post-Only order is one which is “posted” in the order book and which is not executed upon submission.
Post-Only orders add liquidity to the order book (as opposed to taking liquidity), ensuring that traders pay the maker fee upon submission, as opposed to the taker fee.
To enable Post-Only mode, simply check the ""Post Only"" button in the order form prior to submitting your order.

Stop-Limit Orders,"Stop-Limit orders are an order type to limit buy/sell a futures contract once the Mark Price hits your specified Stop Price. It is a conditional order which only becomes active once the Stop price has been hit. Once the Stop price has been hit, a limit buy/sell order will be activated based on your precise input.
For complete Stop-Limit orders, you will need to specify the Stop Price, the order quantity, and the order limit price.
Please note that only Mark Price can be used to specify the Trigger Price of a stop order. In the case of a Buy stop order, the stop price must be below the current Mark Price. For a Sell stop order, the stop price must be above the current Mark Price.
A stop order has three states:
Untriggered
- Market has not reached the Trigger Price.
Triggered
- Market has reached the Trigger Price. The stop order has become active and has entered the order book.
Filled
- After getting activated, the stop order has been filled.
Example
: Let’s say the price is currently $100. Using a Stop-limit order, you can set a stop buy price at $95. Once/if the price hits $95, a limit order will be added to the order book at your specified price and quantity. If the price does not hit $95, the order will remain active without execution.

Market Orders,"A market order is an order type that executes immediately at the best price possible. Market orders on
Delta
will always be filled assuming sufficient order book depth, potentially filling at a number of different prices depending on the number of existing orders in the book at the time.
Market orders match against the best available bids/asks in the order book to ensure the best price possible for a trader.
A market order can be used when speed is prioritized over the exact order execution price. When placing a market order, a trader prioritizes immediate order execution over price/quantity control.
Example
: Using a market order, you can specify the quantity you wish to allocate to an order (e.g. 10% of your wallet). You cannot specify the price however, as this is based on the best available prices in the order book. The order will execute immediately.

Limit Orders,"Limit
orders are a highly effective way of trading on
Delta Exchange
.
A limit order is an order to buy a specified number of futures contracts at a specified price. A limit order only ever executes at the specified price (or better). This provides a trader with full control over the quantity and price of their order.
A limit order is useful for complete order accuracy. This is because the exact price and quantity can be determined prior to the order being executed. As a result, a limit order sacrifices speed and timeliness and risks not getting filled in a fast-moving market.
Example
: Let’s say the current market price is $100. Using limit orders, you can place an order at $95, anticipating further downside. The order will not execute unless the market price hits $95, providing you with a price and quantity guarantee. With a limit order, you run the risk of the price not hitting your target and the order not executing. For a full demonstration, visit our
Limit Order walkthrough. video

Changes in Options Symbology,"We have made a couple of changes to Options Symbology:



1) Tickers are now in format: < option_type > - < asset > - < strike > - < expirydate in ddmmyy >
- Options type is C for calls, P for Puts and MV for MOVE
- Asset is the underlying asset. For example BTC, ETH, LINK etc.

2) We have deprecated symbols which had D,W,M terminology.

3) We have also discontinued Turbo Options."
Margin requirement for MOVE contracts,"The Margin Requirements for MOVE Contracts are fairly straightforward:
Losses for LONGS can never exceed the option premium paid. Because of this, Longs can never get liquidated, and there are
no margin requirements
on the contract.
Losses for SHORTS are theoretically unlimited (if the price was to plummet or skyrocket), and shorts are therefore required to post a
10% margin requirement
.
Short positions on MOVE contracts go into liquidation when
Position Margin
becomes less than the Maintenance Margin of the position, after factoring in unrealised losses.
The liquidation mechanism for MOVE contracts is the same as for futures contracts. A position on Delta is liquidated in a stepwise manner to reduce the market and price impact of liquidations. Traders who short MOVE contracts have the option of enabling
Auto Margin Top-up
to prevent positions from getting liquidated."
When should you trade MOVE options?,"The price and value of a MOVE contract reflect expectations about the volatility of the asset. For example, if you believe that the price of the underlying asset - Bitcoin or Ethereum - will go either up or down, you can long the contract.
On the contrary, if you believe that the underlying asset price will be relatively stable, you can short the MOVE contract. In this trade, you are short volatility. In this way, MOVE contracts on Delta allow you to trade cryptocurrency volatility.
MOVE contracts are useful during times of high market uncertainty with large price swings in either direction. They allow you to profit off of volatility without you having to predict the direction of the price change. As an example, take the FEDs most recent $700 billion injection into the US stock market. Uncertainty surrounded this event and it was difficult to tell whether the news would be interpreted positively or negatively. In a case like this, a MOVE Contract allows you to speculate on the upcoming volatility whilst disregarding the direction of the move."
Types of MOVE contracts,"Delta Exchange offers access to two types of MOVE contracts. Both types - Daily and Weekly - are available for Bitcoin and Ethereum, allowing you to comprehensively trade the daily and weekly volatility of both assets.
Daily MOVE contracts
Daily MOVE contracts track the movement of the underlying asset across a 24 hour period. The ticker for the Delta daily MOVE contract has the following format:
MV-[Underlying_Asset]-D-[Settlement Date]
where Settlement Date is in ddmmyy format. For example, MV-BTC-D-050320 is the ticker of a daily MOVE contract on BTC that will settle on 5th March 2020.
Weekly MOVE contracts
Weekly MOVE contracts track the movement of the underlying asset across a 7 day period. The ticker for weekly MOVE contract has the following format:
MV-[Underlying_Asset]-W-[Settlement Date]
where Settlement Date is in ddmmyy format. For example, MV-ETH-W-130320 is the ticker of a weekly MOVE contract on ETH that will settle on 13th March 2020.
[video width=""1920"" height=""980"" mp4=""http://static.delta.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/move_options.mp4""][/video]"
Key terms for MOVE contracts,"There are a number of key terms that are associated with MOVE contracts that traders should be aware of prior to trading.
Strike Price
The
Strike Price
is the starting price of the contract, measured as the 30 minute TWAP of the underlying asset - Bitcoin or Ethereum.
Settlement Price
The
Settlement Price,
also known as the ending price, is the 30 minute TWAP of the underlying asset - Bitcoin or Ethereum - at time of settlement. The absolute movement of the underlying asset at settlement time is therefore settlement price - strike price.
Last Price
The
Last Price
is the price of the most recent executed trade.
Index Price
The
Index Price
is the spot price of the underlying asset - Bitcoin or Ethereum - useful for reference.
Mark Price
The
Mark Price
is the price used to mark open positions on Delta, for profit/loss calculations and to trigger liquidations. The Mark Price on Delta Exchange is calculated using Fair Price Marketing, which can be read about in more detail
here
.
Premium
The
Premium
is the cost of buying the MOVE contracts. This is calculated as the
Number of Contracts * Entry Price.
In the case of a MOVE contract, long traders pay the cost of the contracts (i.e. the premium) to the selling party. Upon entering a MOVE contract, the premium will be deducted from the balance of the long trader and will be added to the balance of the short trader.
Time to settlement
Settlement Time is the time until the expiration of the MOVE contract. The time to settlement is in the DD:HH:MM format.
24h High / 24h Low
24h High
and
24h Low
show the highest and lowest USD values of the MOVE contract in the previous 24 hours."
How is the profit/ loss for MOVE contracts calculated?,"To calculate your profit or loss on a MOVE contract, compute your
‘pay-off’
minus your
‘premium’
.
The Profit/Loss of a MOVE position can be calculated as follows:
Profit/ Loss
= Pay−off +/− Premium
For longs
Pay−off
= Num_of_contracts ∗ Mark Price
Profit / Loss
= − Premium + (Num_of_contracts ∗ Mark Price)
For shorts
Pay−off
= − Num_of_contracts ∗ Mark Price
Profit / Loss
= Premium − Num_of_contracts * Mark Price
Longing a MOVE contract is profitable when the BTC/ETH price either rises or falls from the strike price by more than the total premium paid. Shorting a MOVE contract is profitable when the price rises or falls from the strike price by less than the total premium paid.
If you buy a move contract with strike price 6500 for $150, then you will make money only if the price is above 6650 or below 6350. In this way, the MOVE price that’s trading in the market tells you what is priced in. You thus make money when what happens to be priced in is incorrect."
How to trade MOVE contracts?,"To trade a MOVE contract on Delta Exchange, follow the instructions below:
Log onto Delta Exchange.
MOVE contracts are margined and settled in USDT. Convert your BTC to USDT if necessary.
Navigate to
MOVE Markets
.
Pick your preferred product:
BTC [Daily expiration]
BTC [Weekly expiration]
ETH [Daily expiration]
ETH [Weekly expiration]
Navigate to the order book on the right hand side of your screen.
Choose your preferred order type - limit, market or stop market.
Choose your direction - long or short.
Taking a Long position implies making a bet on high volatility and price fluctuations.
Taking a Short position implies making a bet on low volatility and price flucuations.
Choose your preferred price and quantity.
Click ‘Place Order’ to finish.

."
Notice about the upcoming Ethereum Merge,"What is Ethereum Merge?
The Merge is a technical upgrade that will shift Ethereum's existing proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. This move will lay the groundwork for future scalability upgrades. This is a hard fork upgrade and hence there's a possibility of creation of a new token.
Expected Timeline
The Merge will occur in two steps, Bellatrix consensus layer upgrade and Paris execution layer upgrade.
Bellatrix consensus layer upgrade:
Ethereum will introduce PoS via Beacon Chain, a separate network outside of Ethereum Mainnet. Bellatrix consensus layer upgrade is set to take place at epoch 144,896 on the Beacon Chain. This is expected to occur on September 6, 2022 at 11:34:47 UTC.
Paris execution layer upgrade:
ETH-PoW chain's migration to the ETH-PoS chain will occur when the Ethereum Mainnet hits the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) value of 58750000000000000000000. The execution layer upgrade (Paris) is expected to take place between 10-20
th
September 2022. Current estimation lies at the
ETH mainnet block height of 15,540,293
, or approximately at
16:10 UTC on 15th September 2022
.
Delta Exchange's stance to The Merge
ETH and ERC-20 Deposits and Withdrawals
Delta Exchange will suspend native ETH & ERC-20 tokens, BSC and BEP-20 deposits and withdrawals at approximately one hour before the Paris execution layer upgrade, i.e. 00:00 UTC, 15 Sep 2022. Post the Merge, ETH, ERC-20 tokens and BEP-20 tokens deposits and withdrawals will be reinstated as soon as possible.
Trading of ETH and ERC-20 Tokens
Trading of ETH and ERC-20 tokens in spot, futures or options will remain un-impacted.
ETH Options Strike Adjustment
Delta Exchange does not plan to adjust ETH options' strikes or open positions in the event one or more forked ETH-PoW blockchains emerge after the Merge. According to learnings from the past forks with respect to BTC and ETH, leading crypto platforms do not adjust perpetual or futures contracts prices after a hard/soft fork. To align with our peers, we plan to 1 not adjust strike prices in options. Furthermore, the settlement price of the ETH options will be based on ETH price on the PoS chain. We however reserve the right to change our current stance as per our
Special Events Handling Policy
.
Support for New PoW ETH Tokens
There's a small possibility that after the Merge, one or more PoW forks of the Ethereum blockchain may emerge. Delta Exchange does not plan to support these PoW tokens. If you have any ETH in your Delta Wallets, post the Merge, you will only get the ETH-PoS token and no other hard forked tokens. Should you wish to get access these potential new tokens, you should withdraw your ETH from Delta Exchange before the Merge.
The ""ETH"" ticker will be used for ETH-PoS token after the Merge.
Important notes
Delta Exchange reserves the right to update its stance in response to the Merge in a further announcement.
It is your responsibility to understand the implications of the Merge. Delta Exchange is not liable for any losses incurred.
Should you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us on

Notice about the upcoming Ethereum London Hard Fork,"The Ethereum blockchain is scheduled to undergo London Upgrade at block height 12,965,000, or approximately at 5th August 2021 12:32pm UTC. The upgrade will result in a hard fork and hence there's a possibility of two temporarily two chains being created.

To manage the risks around this event, we have taken the following steps:
Deposits and withdrawals for ETH and ERC-20 tokens (USDT and DETO) will be suspended at 12:15pm UTC. We will look to resume deposits and withdrawals as soon as the situation is stable. In normal course, withdrawals are processed between 12 - 15pm UTC daily. On 5th August, withdrawals for ETH, USDT and DETO may get delayed. BTC withdrawals will not be impacted.
In the case of a chain-split, we will credit users with the ETH from the chain with the most work done. Users which have ETH balances on Delta may not be able to get the newly created token.
Trading in ETHUSDT Perpetual, ETHBTC Perpetual, ETH Sep Futures, ETH MOVE and ETH Options will continue un-impacted. In case of a split, the index prices of these contracts will follow the chain with the most work done."
Impact of Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork (15-Nov-2020) on BCH Perpetual & Index,"The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain is expected to undergo a hard fork at around 12pm UTC on 15th November. There are two competing hard proposals by the two main BCH clients namely, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN). This is a contentious fork and the ensuing chain-split may result in an additional token.
Product affected
BCHUSDT Perpetual Contract
Index affected
.DEBCHUSDT
.DEBCHUSDT is currently comprised of equal weighted average of BCH-USDT spot prices from Binance and Huobi.
Impact of the hard fork
The above-mentioned product and index will follow the side of the fork which has majority hash power. As things stand today, a significant majority of BCH miners have signalled support for BCHN. If this support persists through the hard for, the BCH spot index and BCH perpetual will follow the BCHN chain. The names of the index and product will remain unchanged.



The situation however remains dynamic. We are closely following the developments relating to the chain-split and will announce which fork the affected index and product will follow as soon as reasonably possible.



As of now, we intend to keep trading in the BCHUSDT perpetual contract open through the hard fork. However, in case the uncertainties around the hard fork increase, we may suspend trading until clarity emerges and price discovery in spot markets happen. Please monitor our
Telegram announcements
and
Twitter
for the most up to date information."

FAQs
How many sub-accounts can I create per Main account?
You can create 2 sub-accounts per Main account.
Can I delete a sub-account?
No, as of now, we do not have this functionality.
Why can't I transfer all my Main account balance to a sub-account?
Trading credits cannot be transferred to a sub-account. Any amount that is blocked on account of trading credits given to you can't be transferred either. Only the amount that can be withdrawn to an external address can be transferred to a sub-account.
Are there any restrictions on transfers between sub-accounts?
We restrict withdrawals from any account for 24 hours after password reset or 2FA enablement/ disablement. This restriction is also applicable to transfers.
Can I take opposing trade positions on different sub accounts?
Yes"
FAQs on 2FA,"We believe that security is of utmost importance to our users and so we highly encourage the adoption of 2FA as an additional layer of protection for your accounts.
What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?
2FA is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts by requiring two forms of authentication before granting access. It typically combines something you know (like a password) with something you have (like a mobile device).
Why should I enable 2FA?
By adding an additional layer of verification, even if someone gains unauthorized access to your password, they would still need the second factor (e.g., your smartphone) to log in. This makes it much harder for malicious actors to compromise your account.
How does 2FA work?
Once set up, whenever you log in to your account, you will be required to enter the verification code generated by the authenticator app. This code is time-sensitive and changes periodically, providing an additional layer of security.
Which Authenticator Apps should I use?
There are several authentication apps available for 2FA such as Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, LastPass Authenticator, and Duo Mobile. Please
click here
to see the complete list of supported authenticator apps.
How do I enable 2Fa?
Visit the
security page
under the profile section couple of minutes to setup 2FA.
What if I lose my device or change my phone?
To avoid being locked out of your account, it's crucial to keep a backup of your 2FA recovery codes provided during the initial setup process. These recovery codes act as a fallback option and can help you regain access to your account in such scenarios.
Can I disable 2FA once it's enabled?
Yes, you can disable 2FA for your account if you no longer wish to use it. However, we strongly recommend keeping 2FA enabled to maintain the highest level of account security.
Are there any drawbacks to using 2FA?
While 2FA significantly enhances account security, it introduces an extra step during the login process. This additional step might cause minor inconvenience, but the increased protection far outweighs any slight inconvenience.
Why do we discourage using Google Authenticator for 2FA?
The cloud sync feature in the Google Authenticator makes it susceptible for hackers to gain access to your 2FA codes.

Fees on Options and Futures Trading,"The trading fees on Delta are mainly charged at the
Notional Size
of the trade
Notional Size = Spot Price * Qty
Spot Price*: click
here
to know more
Example: Options
Let's assume a trader buys 300 contracts of BTC USDT option at a strike price of $26,000 while BTC is trading at 26,200
1 contract of BTC = 0.001 BTC
300 contracts of BTC = 300 * 0.001 = 0.3 BTC
Hence the notional size = 26200 * 0.3 =
$7860
Example: Futures
Let's assume a trader buys 300 contracts of BTC USDT futures at a price of $26,200.
1 contract of BTC = 0.001 BTC
300 contracts of BTC = 300 * 0.001 = 0.3 BTC
Hence the notional size = 26200 * 0.3 =
$7860
Fees in Options Trading (Options and Move Contracts)
Usually the trader will only be paying the Taker/Maker fees while opening or closing a position. This fees remains fixed.
Taker/Maker Fees (0.0375% of the Notional Size)
Taker fee is a trading fee charged to traders who ""take"" liquidity from the order book by executing trades that are immediately matched with existing orders.
Maker fee is a trading fee charged to traders who provide liquidity to the order book by placing limit orders that are not immediately matched with existing orders.
Click

to know more about taker and maker orders.
Fee Capping feature Advantage (12.5% of premium)
Delta Exchange offers a fee capping feature where the trading fee is capped at a maximum of 12.5% of the premium on options contracts. This fee capping advantage can benefit traders who deal with Deep OTM options which have low-premium.
Fee Calculation
Let's assume a trader buys 300 contracts of BTC USDT OTM option at a strike price of $26,000 at a premium of $15 while BTC is trading at $26,200
1 contract of BTC = 0.001 BTC
300 contracts of BTC = 300 * 0.001 = 0.3 BTC
Hence the notional size = 26200 * 0.3 = $7860
Premium Paid = Qty * Premium = 0.3 BTC * $15 = $4.5
Since, the taker/maker fees is 0.0375% the fee would have been
0.0375% * $7860 =
$2.9475.
However, 12.5% of the premium for this trade is
12.5% * $4.5 =
$0.5625.
Since this is less than $2.9475, the user will only pay
$0.5625 as the trading fees
.
The premium capping will be eligible only when the taker/maker fees based on the notional size is more than the fees based on the 12.5% premium calculations.
NOTE
: The calculation will stay the same even in case of option selling.
Fees in Futures Trading (Inverse/USDT Linear Futures)
Usually the trader will only be paying the Taker/Maker fees while opening or closing a position. This fees remains fixed.
Unlike options, the maker fees in Futures is 0.02% less than the taker fees. Hence, a user can take advantage of the less maker fees by ensuring he takes a Maker Order.
Taker Fee: 0.06% of the Notional Size
Maker Fee: 0.04% of the Notional Size
Fee Calculation
Let's assume a trader buys 300 contracts of BTC USDT futures at a price of $26,200.
1 contract of BTC = 0.001 BTC
300 contracts of BTC = 300 * 0.001 = 0.3 BTC
Hence the notional size = 26200 * 0.3 = $7860
Fees for Taker Order will be 0.06% * 7860 =
$4.716
while the
Fees in case it is a Maker Order will be 0.04% * 7860 =
$3.144
NOTE
: The calculation will stay the same even in case of a sell order.

How to use Charting Tools to improve Technical Analysis,"Delta Exchange has integrated Trading View charts that can be used by traders for conducting technical analysis. Here’s the list of features and tools that are at the disposal of traders for enhancing their trading strategies and performance.
1. Multi-Tab Options
The multiple tab option is available on the top of the trading screen interface. The tabs offer different parameters such as traded price, mark price, funding and market dept.
2. Different Chart Types
By default, the chart shown on the interface is a candlestick chart with 15m frequency. However, there are multiple chart options available such as Line, Bars, Hollow Candles and so on, ranging from a frequency of 1 minute to 30 days.
3. Perform Analysis and Technical Studies
This feature on the interface lets traders compare two or more contracts to see if there is any price correlation, draw analysis through data points or track the movement of price. Let’s take, for instance, Bollinger Bands on BTCUSD contract.
Bollinger Bands
is a set of lines plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average. Two standard deviations is not a fixed number and hence traders have the option of changing the standard deviations according to their strategy on the interface. This is what Bollinger Bands on BTCUSD at 1 standard deviation look like.
*The arrow marked in red is where the option to edit charts is available.

After loading a particular study, traders have the option to edit the data points in line with their study.
Please note:
Trading View saves a study in the contract on which the study is created. For example, a trader has created a study on 30 days moving average on BTCUSD. The trader saves the chart as 30MA-BTCUSD. This study is now based on BTCUSD only and
can't be used on another contract
. If the trader then opens ETHUSD chart and opens the moving average study, the BTCUSD contract will also be loaded along with the study. For ETHUSD, a new moving average study needs to be created.
4. Editing Tool
The editing feature lets users choose the tools they are comfortable in using or that help increase the efficiency in making a chart. There are various types of brushes, paint colours, trend lines, a pre-made analysis that traders can load onto their chart. Traders can also add text and can load chart patterns such a Head and Shoulders, Elliot Wave and more.
5. Open charts in full screen or in a new tab
Traders can also view the charts loaded either on the same tab itself, load it on a new window or on full-screen mode. This feature ensures the charts don't clog on one tab itself.
6. Take a Screenshot and Share
Trades can take a screenshot of the charts and indicators they have created, or even wish to share it with other traders or on other platforms."
What is a quanto contract?,"In a typical futures contract, there's a base currency and quote currency. For e.g. in the case of an ETH futures contract that is quoted in USD, ETH is the base currency and USD is the quote currency. The margin and P&L of this contract could be potentially denominated in USD (vanilla futures) or ETH (inverse futures).
Quanto provides a third choice. By using a fixed multiplier the margining and settlement currency can be changed to a third currency. For instance, a BTC-USD multiplier can be defined to create an ETH vanilla quanto that is quoted in USD, but has its margin and P&L denominated in BTC. This is achieved by converting USD values to BTC using a fixed exchange rate provided by the BTC-USD multiplier."
What is an inverse futures contract?,"Consider a futures contract on BTC which is quoted in USD. Here, BTC is the base currency and USD is the quote currency.
In a typical (aka vanilla) futures contract, the margin and profit/ loss are denominated in the quote currency. Thus, a vanila futures on BTC that is quoted in USD is margined and settled in USD.
However, in the case of an inverse contract, margin and profit/ loss are denominated in the base currency. Thus, an inverse futures on BTC that is quoted in USD is margined and settled in BTC."
Sub Accounts: How do they work?,"Sub-accounts are a powerful feature that enable to you to trade through multiple accounts.
Sub-accounts are separate from your ""Main"" account. Each sub-account on Delta Exchange has independent balances, margin and positions and can trade independently. This make sub-accounts helpful in isolating positions, margin or access. Sub-accounts can be used by a single trader to run multiple strategies independently or by a firm with multiple traders, with each trader having its own sub-account.
Sub-account Features
Sub-accounts can be created with or without their own email
Sub-accounts with their own email can be accessed like any other account
Sub-accounts without their own email can be accessed through the Main account or through the sub-account API keys
Each sub-account is independent, in the sense that it has its own balances, deposit addresses, whitelisted withdrawal addresses, API keys and security settings
Sub-accounts inherit the Verification and VIP levels of the Main account
Transfers of balances between sub-accounts are instantaneous and free of charge
Portfolio margin can be enabled only on a single coin per account/ sub-account. By leveraging the sub-accounts feature, portfolio margined positions can be run on multiple coins
The Main account holder has full administrative control over the sub-account. They can enable/ disable 2FA and withdrawals
Note:
Sub accounts cannot claim offers or have trading credits
How to create sub-accounts
Requirements for Sub account creation
The main account holder should have completed the highest level of verification relevant for their country of residence

Paying trading fees in DETO,"DETO can be used for paying fees for trades on Delta Exchange. Please note that this feature is available only to verified users. If you have not yet completed your KYC, you can start the verification process
here
.

There are two other important aspects to paying trading fees in DETO
The DETO that you pay as trading fees will be accepted at a price that is higher of the prevailing market price and the Minimum Support Price (MSP).
MSP
is currently set to $0.10.
For a given trade, only 25% of the trading fees is paid in DETO. The remaining 75% of the trading fees will be paid in the appropriate currency. For example, lets consider a trade which incurs a trading fees of USDT 10. If you have enabled the option of paying trading fees in DETO, you will pay 7.5 USDT and the 2.5 USDT in DETO.
Users in VIP Level 1 or above will not be eligible for paying fees in DETO under MSP program."

How much margin is reserved while placing an order on Delta Exchange?,"When placing an order, margin is reserved for:
Margin for the order
Trading Fees
Order Margin
The margin requirement while placing an order is the
Initial Margin
.
Order Margin = Order Size * Notional Value of 1 contract x Initial Margin%
Initial Margin% can vary from contract to contract and is specified in the
contract specification
.

At Delta we use
margin scaling
which means as order/ position size increases, the margin requirement increases too.

Current Initial Margin% = Initial Margin% + Slope_IM * (Order Size – Order Threshold)
What happens when you already have an open position/orders?
Delta Exchange uses
Isolated Margin System
. Therefore, all open positions have dedicated margin associated with it. But all open orders on a contract share a pool of margin that supports all of them. Due to this:
All orders open in a selected contract are at the
same leverage.
Margin offsetting occurs. All open position and open orders, including the one being placed, are considered. Opposite side position and open orders are netted and the margin for supporting the open position and open orders is computed.
This offsetting reduces the margin requirement considerably.
For example, John places a long order for 100 BTCUSD contracts at 10x leverage. Margin is blocked and the order becomes a position. Now, John places a short order for 100 BTCUSD at 10x leverage. Since John already has an open position in the opposite direction in this contract,
NO margin
is required to place this order.
This is Margin Offsetting.
Trading Fees
When placing an order trading fees are reserved in advance. Depending on the type of order that is executed traders are charged with either Taker Fees or Maker Fees. Reservation of Fees occur when:
An order becomes a position
On closing a position
Therefore with each order, estimated trading fees for opening execution (order becomes a position) and closing execution (position is closed) are reserved. Click here to know more about
Make
and Taker Fees
.
Trading Fees Reserved = (Quantity x Entry_Price x Fee) + (Quantity x Exit_Price x Fee)
*Entry_Price and Exit_Price are estimated using the order characteristics and prevailing prices.

Hence, the margin reserved includes
Order Margin + Trading Fees Reserved."
How to use Charting Tools to improve Technical Analysis,"Delta Exchange has integrated Trading View charts that can be used by traders for conducting technical analysis. Here’s the list of features and tools that are at the disposal of traders for enhancing their trading strategies and performance.
1. Multi-Tab Options
The multiple tab option is available on the top of the trading screen interface. The tabs offer different parameters such as traded price, mark price, funding and market dept.
2. Different Chart Types
By default, the chart shown on the interface is a candlestick chart with 15m frequency. However, there are multiple chart options available such as Line, Bars, Hollow Candles and so on, ranging from a frequency of 1 minute to 30 days.
3. Perform Analysis and Technical Studies
This feature on the interface lets traders compare two or more contracts to see if there is any price correlation, draw analysis through data points or track the movement of price. Let’s take, for instance, Bollinger Bands on BTCUSD contract.
Bollinger Bands
is a set of lines plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average. Two standard deviations is not a fixed number and hence traders have the option of changing the standard deviations according to their strategy on the interface. This is what Bollinger Bands on BTCUSD at 1 standard deviation look like.
*The arrow marked in red is where the option to edit charts is available.

After loading a particular study, traders have the option to edit the data points in line with their study.
Please note:
Trading View saves a study in the contract on which the study is created. For example, a trader has created a study on 30 days moving average on BTCUSD. The trader saves the chart as 30MA-BTCUSD. This study is now based on BTCUSD only and
can't be used on another contract
. If the trader then opens ETHUSD chart and opens the moving average study, the BTCUSD contract will also be loaded along with the study. For ETHUSD, a new moving average study needs to be created.
4. Editing Tool
The editing feature lets users choose the tools they are comfortable in using or that help increase the efficiency in making a chart. There are various types of brushes, paint colours, trend lines, a pre-made analysis that traders can load onto their chart. Traders can also add text and can load chart patterns such a Head and Shoulders, Elliot Wave and more.
5. Open charts in full screen or in a new tab
Traders can also view the charts loaded either on the same tab itself, load it on a new window or on full-screen mode. This feature ensures the charts don't clog on one tab itself.
6. Take a Screenshot and Share
Trades can take a screenshot of the charts and indicators they have created, or even wish to share it with other traders or on other platforms."
Delta Exchange Calculator: Features to Improve Trading,"The calculator on Delta Exchange provides various features that help traders understand their Liquidation Price, Profit and Loss, Trade Size, without having to do any manual calculations. These features enable traders to better utilize their capital, size their trades effectively and do better risk management.
*Please note trading fees and funding payments are not included in the calculations. Currently, the calculator is available only for futures.
Navigating on the screen:
Once you are on the trading screen, the Calculator option can be selected by clicking on the calculator icon, on the extreme right of the screen, near ‘Place Order’.
1. Liquidation Price
This feature helps traders to know the liquidation price in advance before executing a trade and optimizing a risk management technique if required.
Click on ‘Liquidation Price’ Option
Select ‘Long’ or ‘Short’
Enter Quantity, Entry Price and chose the leverage by sliding the leverage lever.
The calculator then produces the price at which the trade be liquidated.
While calculating the Liquidation Price, the calculator also takes into consideration the already existing positions on that contract and provides the results accordingly.
2. Profit/Loss
The PnL on a trade will always be the same, irrespective of the leverage used. If a trader enters of 1 contract on BTCUSD trade at $9000 and exits at $9500, the PnL in terms of BTC will remain the same at 0.00000585 BTC at 1x leverage, 10x leverage or 100x leverage. The change is reflected in the margin used and ROE levels only. Follow the video to know more.
Select the ‘Profit/Loss’ Option
Enter the values in Quantity, Entry Price, Exit Price, and select the leverage by sliding on the leverage lever.
The calculator will then reflect the margin, PnL and ROE% made on the trade.
3. Trade Size
This feature helps traders to know the position size they are taking in a particular trade and helps them strategize their trade better.
Click on the ‘Trade Size’ option in the calculator.
The trader then needs to enter values in the Entry Price, Margin and Leverage for the trade.
The calculator then calculates the trade size.
Trade size also takes into consideration all open orders and positions.
4. Target Price
Target Price is a great feature for traders who do not have an Exit Price in mind but know the percentage returns they want to make on trades using leverage.
Click on the ‘Target Price’ option.
After selecting either ‘Long’ or ‘Short’ the trader needs to select the leverage, entry price and what ROE% they would like from that trade.
The calculator then calculates the Target Price for the trade.
These are the various features the Calculator on Delta Exchange provides. In case you wish to see any additional features please write to us at

How are Stop Orders Margined on Delta Exchange?,"When an order is placed on Delta Exchange, margin is blocked for it. This is known as order margin. This means that a trader needs to have sufficient balance in his account to provide margin for an order. In case a trader wishes to place multiple orders, the order margin requirement will be higher, albeit margin offsetting is provided to ensure greater capital efficiency for traders.

The
exception
to this rule is stop orders. While placing a Stop Order,
NO order margin is blocked
. A trader can place multiple stop orders at no additional margin from their account. This helps traders keep multiple stop orders open without having to worry about margin.

Stop orders are conditional orders which result in a market or limit order being sent to the matching engine once the trigger condition has been met. Keeping this nature of stop orders in mind, we look for margin for stop orders only after they have been triggered.

Nevertheless, once the trigger price has been hit, margin is then required for the order. At this point, traders need to ensure they have sufficient balance in their account for the order to be placed. In case, the trader does not have sufficient balance in their account, the stop orders are
CANCELLED
. Many times traders use their entire capital in a single trade without keeping some balance left. During such instances, if by chance, their trigger price has been hit, the stop order will not be placed."
What happens to Open Orders when a Position is liquidated?,"When a position is liquidated on Delta Exchange, all open orders of that contract are
cancelled.
Open Orders and Positions for other contracts are not affected and those orders remain untouched.
Why does this happen?
All Orders on Delta Exchange are traded on Isolated Margin. Isolated Margin is the margin that is dedicated to just a single position irrespective of portfolio margin. Through Isolated Margin, the most a trader can lose in a trade is the margin put up for that trade only.
Click here
to know more about Isolated Margin.
Similarly, all open orders too have dedicated margin. But to keep margin requirement low or improve capital usage efficiency for traders, we provide margin offsetting. If a trader places an order which will close an open position, no margin is charged for it.

While closing a position, the margin requirement for the open orders on that contract may change because some of the benefits of margin offsetting may go away. Delta can potentially do one of the three things:
Draw more margin from the trader’s available balance to support the new margin requirement.
Cancel some of the open orders to reduce the margin requirement.
Cancel all the open orders.
We have chosen the third option because we don’t want to make decisions on behalf of traders.
A scenario of a position getting liquidated and all Open Orders being cancelled
Bob has entered into a long position on BTCUSD at $8000 using 50x leverage. The liquidation price for this position is $7882. The price has fallen to $7881 and Liquidation Engine has taken over the position and tries to close the position at the best price possible.

At this point, if Bob has placed multiple open orders on BTCUSD, those open order will be cancelled. Thus, even though Bob has placed an open buy order at $7880 in the order books, the order will be cancelled due to liquidation.
The reason Open Orders on other contracts is not cancelled is that on Delta Exchange traders use
Isolated Margin instead of Cross Margin."
"Time in Force Flags on Delta Exchange – IOC, GTC","Time in Force Flags provides traders with a way to create specific behaviour of orders for a more sophisticated trading strategy. These types of orders are useful in the way, that they are another tool you can use to help manage risk, maximise returns and minimise losses.
Click here
to know more about the different order types on Delta Exchange.
Time in Force Flags
Time in Force is a special instruction used to indicate how long will an order remain active for before it is executed or cancelled. This gives a trader the mechanism of controlling time for a particular trade.

Below are the 3 different types of TIF Flags on Delta Exchange:
Immediate or Cancel
An Immediate or Cancel (IOC) Order is an order that is executed immediately. If there is partial execution, the unfilled portion of the order is cancelled immediately. This guarantees immediate execution at the specified limit price or better. In case the order cannot be fulfilled the Limit IOC Order is then cancelled.

IOC orders are always executed as taker orders and hence incur taker fees.
When to use IOC
Traders usually use Limit IOC when they want to acquire or load off shares within a price range. In essence, Limit IOC is a combination of a Limit Order and Market Order.

While closing a position from the positions tab, the Limit IOC option is available.
Click here
to know more.
Good till Cancelled
A Good till Cancelled Order or a GTC order is an open order till it is either executed or cancelled by the trader. If there is partial execution of an order, the remaining quantity is open till the order is either executed or cancelled. All Limit Orders on Delta Exchange are by default a GTC order

GTC orders may get executed either as a taker or maker order. To ensure that a GTC order is executed as a maker order, you can make it
post-only.
When to use GTC
Traders usually place a GTC order when they want to buy below the current market price or want to sell above the current market price. Usually, when a trader is not too particular on the trade being executed immediately, a trader will place GTC as there is uncertainty when the entire order will be fulfilled based on price and quantity."

How to Close an Open Position on Delta Exchange,"There are two ways on how to exit an Open Position
Place an order of the same size and the opposite direction.
Close the position from the Positions widget
Closing a position from the Position Widget
Once an order has been placed, the tab of open positions shows all the details of the order that has been placed. In the Positions widget, you will see the net amount of contracts you are long or short, quantity in each contract, entry price, and liquidation price and so on.
To the extreme right is the option of ‘Close Position’. A trader can choose between two options while closing an order:
Market Order
Limit IOC
Market Order is closing the position at the best available price. The greatest advantage of a market order is that the order will be immediately filled if there is enough liquidity in the order book.But execution price is not guaranteed and if position size is large relative to liquidity in the order book, you may incur slippages.

Limit IOC stands for Immediate or Cancel. A limit IOC order can be executed partially or fully based on the available quantity, and the remaining lot is cancelled immediately. From the order book screenshot below, a trader wishes to buy 10,000 contracts at $9379.However, only 9901 are available at the price. Thus, the trader receives 9901 contracts are the remaining are cancelled. Click here to know more on Limit IOC orders.
Closing a position fully or partially
Once the trader has decided which type of order he wants to place, the trader then needs to decide the quantity of the contracts. The trader can wish to close the entire position or a part of it. Delta Exchange offers an inbuilt calculation which provides the option of closing 25%, 50% 75% or the entire 100% of your open position.
Open Orders may get cancelled
Delta Exchange offers Order Offsetting for open positions and open orders. Once a position is closed, open orders may require additional margin. In case, additional margin is not available for these open orders once the position is closed, the open orders are cancelled. Click here to know more on Order Offsetting.

Summary of changes made to funding mechanism for perpetual contracts,"We have recently made a few important changes to the mechanics of funding rate for perpetual contracts. While the
user guide
has been updated and has full details of how funding works, we are highlighting the changes that have been made here.
The formula used to compute funding has been changed
The new formula for funding rate is:
Funding Rate = Avg Premium + clamp (Interest Rate - Avg Premium, 0.05%, -0.05%)
where, Avg Premium is the 8-hour TWAP of the contract's premium (i.e. % difference of the contract's mark price and the underlying index price) and Interest Rate is the differential of borrow rates of the quoting currency and base currency.

As of now, Interest Rate for all contract is set to 0.01%/ 8h.

After this change, our funding computation formula is in line with the industry. Further, the use of clamp function helps to keep the magnitude of funding low. For e.g. when Avg Premium varies from (-0.04%, 0.06%), the funding rate will stay flat at 0.01%.
Funding now changes once every 8 hours
Previously, funding rate was computed every minute. Thus, funding rate could potentially change every minute. Now, funding is computed once every 8 hours. So, funding rate stays flat for 8 hours. Again, this is in line with the well accepted industry practices.

The lesser fluctuation/ greater certainty in funding rates will also enable traders to run long/ short strategies for perpetual/ futures and perpetual/ spot pair trades more profitably.
Funding is still exchanged every minute
This is where we are different from many of our peers. On most derivative exchanges, funding is exchanged between longs/ shorts once every 8 hours. On Delta Exchange, this exchange of funding is a continuous process that happens once every minute.This means as long as you are in a position, you are always either receiving funding or paying funding.
Funding Caps are lower
In response to demand from our traders, we have made funding caps tighter for most contracts. With the exception of a few contracts, funding caps for perpetual contracts are now set at 0.1%/ 8h.

You can find the funding cap for a contract in its
specifications
.
Impact sizes are lower
We have also lowered impact sizes for most contracts, bringing them in line with market accepted practices. The impact size for a contract is pertinent to computation of mark price and hence, computation of the funding rate.

You can find the impact size for a contract in its
specifications
."
Are there any limits on funding?,"Yes, the maximum value of funding rate at any instant (regardless of the sign) is capped. This 'Funding Cap' can vary from contract to contract and is available on the
contract specifications page."
How can I see the history of funding for any contract?,You can see the funding rate history for a selected perpetual contract by selecting the ‘Funding’ tab in the chart.
What is funding?,"A perpetual contract is designed to trade close to spot. Funding is the mechanism which helps to achieve this. It is a series of continuous payments that are exchanged between longs and shorts in a perpetual contract.

When a perpetual contract is trading at a premium to spot, funding is positive and longs pay shorts. This creates a downward pressure on the contract's price. Conversely, when a perpetual contract is trading at a discount to spot, funding is negative and shorts pay longs. In this situation, there is an upward pressure on the contract's price.

It is important to note that funding payments are completely peer to peer. Delta Exchange does not charge any fees on funding payments.

Time-In-Force Orders,"Time-In-Force orders refer to order instructions which indicate how long an open order will remain active for before it expires. This provides traders with an additional measure of control when opening active positions.

There are 2 available Time-in-Force orders available on
Delta Exchange
- GTC & IOC.
GTC
- GTC, or Good-Till-Cancelled, ensures that the order remains active until cancellation by the trader. When using this order type, an order will either execute or be manually canceled by the trader.
IOC
- IOC, or Immediate-Or-Cancel, ensures that any unfilled parts of an order are canceled immediately if not filled. IOC orders will as large a part of an order as possible, canceling the rest immediately.
Time-In-Force orders are a powerful tool for traders to improve control over the timing and execution of their orders on Delta.

Reduce-Only Orders,"Reduce-only orders allow traders to execute buy or sell orders which only reduce a current position, as opposed to opening an opposite long or short worth more than the existing value of your assets,
letting you trade without the risk of over-exposing your positions.
Orders marked as ""reduce-only"" will be canceled if they would result in increasing the position size in the opposite direction. Whilst the reduce-only flag can be used with any order type, it is most useful when combined with stop orders.

Trailing-Stop Orders,"Trailing-stop orders are an order type that activates once/if the market price goes against you by a set amount, referred to as the Trail Amount, providing you with added flexibility and automation. The stop price follows the market at a fixed distance if the price is moving in favor of your order. The stop price remains unchanged when the market is moving against the trader, however, protecting against potential losses. This enables a trader to specify a limit on the maximum possible loss (the trail amount), without having to set a limit on the maximum possible gain. When the market reaches the trigger price, a market order is activated.
Example
: If a trader is in a long position and the current price is 500, a trader can open trailing-stop orders with a price distance of 20. This will create a sell stop order at 480. Contrary to a normal stop order, if the price continues to rise to 550, the trailing stop rises accordingly to 530. If the price falls to 530, a market order is activated.

Post-Only Orders,"Post-Only orders are a limit order type on
Delta
which is only accepted if it does not immediately match with an existing order in the book. In line with this, a Post-Only order is one which is “posted” in the order book and which is not executed upon submission.
Post-Only orders add liquidity to the order book (as opposed to taking liquidity), ensuring that traders pay the maker fee upon submission, as opposed to the taker fee.
To enable Post-Only mode, simply check the ""Post Only"" button in the order form prior to submitting your order.

Stop-Limit Orders,"Stop-Limit orders are an order type to limit buy/sell a futures contract once the Mark Price hits your specified Stop Price. It is a conditional order which only becomes active once the Stop price has been hit. Once the Stop price has been hit, a limit buy/sell order will be activated based on your precise input.
For complete Stop-Limit orders, you will need to specify the Stop Price, the order quantity, and the order limit price.
Please note that only Mark Price can be used to specify the Trigger Price of a stop order. In the case of a Buy stop order, the stop price must be below the current Mark Price. For a Sell stop order, the stop price must be above the current Mark Price.
A stop order has three states:
Untriggered
- Market has not reached the Trigger Price.
Triggered
- Market has reached the Trigger Price. The stop order has become active and has entered the order book.
Filled
- After getting activated, the stop order has been filled.
Example
: Let’s say the price is currently $100. Using a Stop-limit order, you can set a stop buy price at $95. Once/if the price hits $95, a limit order will be added to the order book at your specified price and quantity. If the price does not hit $95, the order will remain active without execution.

Stop-Market Orders,"Stop-Market orders are orders to market buy/sell a futures contract once the Mark Price hits your specified Stop Price. It is a conditional order which only becomes active once the Stop price has been hit. Once the Stop price has been hit, a market buy/sell order will be activated.
Please note that only Mark Price can be used to specify the Trigger Price of a stop order. In the case of a Buy stop order, the stop price must be below the current Mark Price. For a Sell stop order, the stop price must be above the current Mark Price.

Market Orders,"A market order is an order type that executes immediately at the best price possible. Market orders on
Delta
will always be filled assuming sufficient order book depth, potentially filling at a number of different prices depending on the number of existing orders in the book at the time.
Market orders match against the best available bids/asks in the order book to ensure the best price possible for a trader.
A market order can be used when speed is prioritized over the exact order execution price. When placing a market order, a trader prioritizes immediate order execution over price/quantity control.
Example
: Using a market order, you can specify the quantity you wish to allocate to an order (e.g. 10% of your wallet). You cannot specify the price however, as this is based on the best available prices in the order book. The order will execute immediately.

Limit Orders,"Limit
orders are a highly effective way of trading on
Delta Exchange
.
A limit order is an order to buy a specified number of futures contracts at a specified price. A limit order only ever executes at the specified price (or better). This provides a trader with full control over the quantity and price of their order.
A limit order is useful for complete order accuracy. This is because the exact price and quantity can be determined prior to the order being executed. As a result, a limit order sacrifices speed and timeliness and risks not getting filled in a fast-moving market.
Example
: Let’s say the current market price is $100. Using limit orders, you can place an order at $95, anticipating further downside. The order will not execute unless the market price hits $95, providing you with a price and quantity guarantee. With a limit order, you run the risk of the price not hitting your target and the order not executing. For a full demonstration, visit our
Limit Order walkthrough. video

Changes in Options Symbology,"We have made a couple of changes to Options Symbology:



1) Tickers are now in format: < option_type > - < asset > - < strike > - < expirydate in ddmmyy >
- Options type is C for calls, P for Puts and MV for MOVE
- Asset is the underlying asset. For example BTC, ETH, LINK etc.

2) We have deprecated symbols which had D,W,M terminology.

3) We have also discontinued Turbo Options."
Margin requirement for MOVE contracts,"The Margin Requirements for MOVE Contracts are fairly straightforward:
Losses for LONGS can never exceed the option premium paid. Because of this, Longs can never get liquidated, and there are
no margin requirements
on the contract.
Losses for SHORTS are theoretically unlimited (if the price was to plummet or skyrocket), and shorts are therefore required to post a
10% margin requirement
.
Short positions on MOVE contracts go into liquidation when
Position Margin
becomes less than the Maintenance Margin of the position, after factoring in unrealised losses.
The liquidation mechanism for MOVE contracts is the same as for futures contracts. A position on Delta is liquidated in a stepwise manner to reduce the market and price impact of liquidations. Traders who short MOVE contracts have the option of enabling
Auto Margin Top-up
to prevent positions from getting liquidated."
When should you trade MOVE options?,"The price and value of a MOVE contract reflect expectations about the volatility of the asset. For example, if you believe that the price of the underlying asset - Bitcoin or Ethereum - will go either up or down, you can long the contract.
On the contrary, if you believe that the underlying asset price will be relatively stable, you can short the MOVE contract. In this trade, you are short volatility. In this way, MOVE contracts on Delta allow you to trade cryptocurrency volatility.
MOVE contracts are useful during times of high market uncertainty with large price swings in either direction. They allow you to profit off of volatility without you having to predict the direction of the price change. As an example, take the FEDs most recent $700 billion injection into the US stock market. Uncertainty surrounded this event and it was difficult to tell whether the news would be interpreted positively or negatively. In a case like this, a MOVE Contract allows you to speculate on the upcoming volatility whilst disregarding the direction of the move."
Types of MOVE contracts,"Delta Exchange offers access to two types of MOVE contracts. Both types - Daily and Weekly - are available for Bitcoin and Ethereum, allowing you to comprehensively trade the daily and weekly volatility of both assets.
Daily MOVE contracts
Daily MOVE contracts track the movement of the underlying asset across a 24 hour period. The ticker for the Delta daily MOVE contract has the following format:
MV-[Underlying_Asset]-D-[Settlement Date]
where Settlement Date is in ddmmyy format. For example, MV-BTC-D-050320 is the ticker of a daily MOVE contract on BTC that will settle on 5th March 2020.
Weekly MOVE contracts
Weekly MOVE contracts track the movement of the underlying asset across a 7 day period. The ticker for weekly MOVE contract has the following format:

Key terms for MOVE contracts,"There are a number of key terms that are associated with MOVE contracts that traders should be aware of prior to trading.
Strike Price
The
Strike Price
is the starting price of the contract, measured as the 30 minute TWAP of the underlying asset - Bitcoin or Ethereum.
Settlement Price
The
Settlement Price,
also known as the ending price, is the 30 minute TWAP of the underlying asset - Bitcoin or Ethereum - at time of settlement. The absolute movement of the underlying asset at settlement time is therefore settlement price - strike price.
Last Price
The
Last Price
is the price of the most recent executed trade.
Index Price
The
Index Price
is the spot price of the underlying asset - Bitcoin or Ethereum - useful for reference.
Mark Price
The
Mark Price
is the price used to mark open positions on Delta, for profit/loss calculations and to trigger liquidations. The Mark Price on Delta Exchange is calculated using Fair Price Marketing, which can be read about in more detail
here
.
Premium
The
Premium
is the cost of buying the MOVE contracts. This is calculated as the
Number of Contracts * Entry Price.
In the case of a MOVE contract, long traders pay the cost of the contracts (i.e. the premium) to the selling party. Upon entering a MOVE contract, the premium will be deducted from the balance of the long trader and will be added to the balance of the short trader.
Time to settlement
Settlement Time is the time until the expiration of the MOVE contract. The time to settlement is in the DD:HH:MM format.
24h High / 24h Low
24h High
and
24h Low
show the highest and lowest USD values of the MOVE contract in the previous 24 hours."
How is the profit/ loss for MOVE contracts calculated?,"To calculate your profit or loss on a MOVE contract, compute your
‘pay-off’
minus your
‘premium’
.
The Profit/Loss of a MOVE position can be calculated as follows:
Profit/ Loss
= Pay−off +/− Premium
For longs
Pay−off
= Num_of_contracts ∗ Mark Price
Profit / Loss
= − Premium + (Num_of_contracts ∗ Mark Price)
For shorts
Pay−off
= − Num_of_contracts ∗ Mark Price
Profit / Loss
= Premium − Num_of_contracts * Mark Price
Longing a MOVE contract is profitable when the BTC/ETH price either rises or falls from the strike price by more than the total premium paid. Shorting a MOVE contract is profitable when the price rises or falls from the strike price by less than the total premium paid.
If you buy a move contract with strike price 6500 for $150, then you will make money only if the price is above 6650 or below 6350. In this way, the MOVE price that’s trading in the market tells you what is priced in. You thus make money when what happens to be priced in is incorrect."
How to trade MOVE contracts?,"To trade a MOVE contract on Delta Exchange, follow the instructions below:
Log onto Delta Exchange.
MOVE contracts are margined and settled in USDT. Convert your BTC to USDT if necessary.
Navigate to
MOVE Markets
.

The notice about other implications of the upcoming Ethereum Merge for Delta Exchange's users is available
here
."
Notice about the upcoming Ethereum Merge,"What is Ethereum Merge?
The Merge is a technical upgrade that will shift Ethereum's existing proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. This move will lay the groundwork for future scalability upgrades. This is a hard fork upgrade and hence there's a possibility of creation of a new token.
Expected Timeline
The Merge will occur in two steps, Bellatrix consensus layer upgrade and Paris execution layer upgrade.
Bellatrix consensus layer upgrade:
Ethereum will introduce PoS via Beacon Chain, a separate network outside of Ethereum Mainnet. Bellatrix consensus layer upgrade is set to take place at epoch 144,896 on the Beacon Chain. This is expected to occur on September 6, 2022 at 11:34:47 UTC.
Paris execution layer upgrade:
ETH-PoW chain's migration to the ETH-PoS chain will occur when the Ethereum Mainnet hits the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) value of 58750000000000000000000. The execution layer upgrade (Paris) is expected to take place between 10-20
th
September 2022. Current estimation lies at the
ETH mainnet block height of 15,540,293
, or approximately at
16:10 UTC on 15th September 2022

Delta Exchange will suspend native ETH & ERC-20 tokens, BSC and BEP-20 deposits and withdrawals at approximately one hour before the Paris execution layer upgrade, i.e. 00:00 UTC, 15 Sep 2022. Post the Merge, ETH, ERC-20 tokens and BEP-20 tokens deposits and withdrawals will be reinstated as soon as possible.
Trading of ETH and ERC-20 Tokens
Trading of ETH and ERC-20 tokens in spot, futures or options will remain un-impacted.
ETH Options Strike Adjustment
Delta Exchange does not plan to adjust ETH options' strikes or open positions in the event one or more forked ETH-PoW blockchains emerge after the Merge. According to learnings from the past forks with respect to BTC and ETH, leading crypto platforms do not adjust perpetual or futures contracts prices after a hard/soft fork. To align with our peers, we plan to 1 not adjust strike prices in options. Furthermore, the settlement price of the ETH options will be based on ETH price on the PoS chain. We however reserve the right to change our current stance as per our
Special Events Handling Policy
.
Support for New PoW ETH Tokens
There's a small possibility that after the Merge, one or more PoW forks of the Ethereum blockchain may emerge. Delta Exchange does not plan to support these PoW tokens. If you have any ETH in your Delta Wallets, post the Merge, you will only get the ETH-PoS token and no other hard forked tokens. Should you wish to get access these potential new tokens, you should withdraw your ETH from Delta Exchange before the Merge.
The ""ETH"" ticker will be used for ETH-PoS token after the Merge.
Important notes
Delta Exchange reserves the right to update its stance in response to the Merge in a further announcement.
It is your responsibility to understand the implications of the Merge. Delta Exchange is not liable for any losses incurred.

Notice about the upcoming Ethereum London Hard Fork,"The Ethereum blockchain is scheduled to undergo London Upgrade at block height 12,965,000, or approximately at 5th August 2021 12:32pm UTC. The upgrade will result in a hard fork and hence there's a possibility of two temporarily two chains being created.

To manage the risks around this event, we have taken the following steps:
Deposits and withdrawals for ETH and ERC-20 tokens (USDT and DETO) will be suspended at 12:15pm UTC. We will look to resume deposits and withdrawals as soon as the situation is stable. In normal course, withdrawals are processed between 12 - 15pm UTC daily. On 5th August, withdrawals for ETH, USDT and DETO may get delayed. BTC withdrawals will not be impacted.
In the case of a chain-split, we will credit users with the ETH from the chain with the most work done. Users which have ETH balances on Delta may not be able to get the newly created token.
Trading in ETHUSDT Perpetual, ETHBTC Perpetual, ETH Sep Futures, ETH MOVE and ETH Options will continue un-impacted. In case of a split, the index prices of these contracts will follow the chain with the most work done."
Impact of Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork (15-Nov-2020) on BCH Perpetual & Index,"The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain is expected to undergo a hard fork at around 12pm UTC on 15th November. There are two competing hard proposals by the two main BCH clients namely, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN). This is a contentious fork and the ensuing chain-split may result in an additional token.
Product affected
BCHUSDT Perpetual Contract
Index affected
.DEBCHUSDT
.DEBCHUSDT is currently comprised of equal weighted average of BCH-USDT spot prices from Binance and Huobi.
Impact of the hard fork
The above-mentioned product and index will follow the side of the fork which has majority hash power. As things stand today, a significant majority of BCH miners have signalled support for BCHN. If this support persists through the hard for, the BCH spot index and BCH perpetual will follow the BCHN chain. The names of the index and product will remain unchanged.



The situation however remains dynamic. We are closely following the developments relating to the chain-split and will announce which fork the affected index and product will follow as soon as reasonably possible.



As of now, we intend to keep trading in the BCHUSDT perpetual contract open through the hard fork. However, in case the uncertainties around the hard fork increase, we may suspend trading until clarity emerges and price discovery in spot markets happen. Please monitor our
Telegram announcements
and
Twitter
for the most up to date information."

Sub Accounts: How do they work?,"Sub-accounts are a powerful feature that enable to you to trade through multiple accounts.
Sub-accounts are separate from your ""Main"" account. Each sub-account on Delta Exchange has independent balances, margin and positions and can trade independently. This make sub-accounts helpful in isolating positions, margin or access. Sub-accounts can be used by a single trader to run multiple strategies independently or by a firm with multiple traders, with each trader having its own sub-account.

FAQs
How many sub-accounts can I create per Main account?
You can create 2 sub-accounts per Main account.
Can I delete a sub-account?
No, as of now, we do not have this functionality.
Why can't I transfer all my Main account balance to a sub-account?
Trading credits cannot be transferred to a sub-account. Any amount that is blocked on account of trading credits given to you can't be transferred either. Only the amount that can be withdrawn to an external address can be transferred to a sub-account.
Are there any restrictions on transfers between sub-accounts?
We restrict withdrawals from any account for 24 hours after password reset or 2FA enablement/ disablement. This restriction is also applicable to transfers.
Can I take opposing trade positions on different sub accounts?
Yes"
FAQs on 2FA,"We believe that security is of utmost importance to our users and so we highly encourage the adoption of 2FA as an additional layer of protection for your accounts.
What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?
2FA is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts by requiring two forms of authentication before granting access. It typically combines something you know (like a password) with something you have (like a mobile device).
Why should I enable 2FA?
By adding an additional layer of verification, even if someone gains unauthorized access to your password, they would still need the second factor (e.g., your smartphone) to log in. This makes it much harder for malicious actors to compromise your account.
How does 2FA work?
Once set up, whenever you log in to your account, you will be required to enter the verification code generated by the authenticator app. This code is time-sensitive and changes periodically, providing an additional layer of security.
Which Authenticator Apps should I use?
There are several authentication apps available for 2FA such as Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, LastPass Authenticator, and Duo Mobile. Please
click here
to see the complete list of supported authenticator apps.
How do I enable 2Fa?
Visit the
security page
under the profile section couple of minutes to setup 2FA.
What if I lose my device or change my phone?
To avoid being locked out of your account, it's crucial to keep a backup of your 2FA recovery codes provided during the initial setup process. These recovery codes act as a fallback option and can help you regain access to your account in such scenarios.
Can I disable 2FA once it's enabled?
Yes, you can disable 2FA for your account if you no longer wish to use it. However, we strongly recommend keeping 2FA enabled to maintain the highest level of account security.
Are there any drawbacks to using 2FA?
While 2FA significantly enhances account security, it introduces an extra step during the login process. This additional step might cause minor inconvenience, but the increased protection far outweighs any slight inconvenience.
Why do we discourage using Google Authenticator for 2FA?
The cloud sync feature in the Google Authenticator makes it susceptible for hackers to gain access to your 2FA codes.

Fees on Options and Futures Trading,"The trading fees on Delta are mainly charged at the
Notional Size
of the trade
Notional Size = Spot Price * Qty
Spot Price*: click
here
to know more
Example: Options
Let's assume a trader buys 300 contracts of BTC USDT option at a strike price of $26,000 while BTC is trading at 26,200
1 contract of BTC = 0.001 BTC
300 contracts of BTC = 300 * 0.001 = 0.3 BTC
Hence the notional size = 26200 * 0.3 =
$7860
Example: Futures
Let's assume a trader buys 300 contracts of BTC USDT futures at a price of $26,200.
1 contract of BTC = 0.001 BTC
300 contracts of BTC = 300 * 0.001 = 0.3 BTC
Hence the notional size = 26200 * 0.3 =
$7860
Fees in Options Trading (Options and Move Contracts)
Usually the trader will only be paying the Taker/Maker fees while opening or closing a position. This fees remains fixed.
Taker/Maker Fees (0.0375% of the Notional Size)
Taker fee is a trading fee charged to traders who ""take"" liquidity from the order book by executing trades that are immediately matched with existing orders.
Maker fee is a trading fee charged to traders who provide liquidity to the order book by placing limit orders that are not immediately matched with existing orders.

to know more about taker and maker orders.
Fee Capping feature Advantage (12.5% of premium)
Delta Exchange offers a fee capping feature where the trading fee is capped at a maximum of 12.5% of the premium on options contracts. This fee capping advantage can benefit traders who deal with Deep OTM options which have low-premium.
Fee Calculation
Let's assume a trader buys 300 contracts of BTC USDT OTM option at a strike price of $26,000 at a premium of $15 while BTC is trading at $26,200
1 contract of BTC = 0.001 BTC
300 contracts of BTC = 300 * 0.001 = 0.3 BTC
Hence the notional size = 26200 * 0.3 = $7860
Premium Paid = Qty * Premium = 0.3 BTC * $15 = $4.5
Since, the taker/maker fees is 0.0375% the fee would have been
0.0375% * $7860 =
$2.9475.
However, 12.5% of the premium for this trade is
12.5% * $4.5 =
$0.5625.
Since this is less than $2.9475, the user will only pay
$0.5625 as the trading fees
.
The premium capping will be eligible only when the taker/maker fees based on the notional size is more than the fees based on the 12.5% premium calculations.
NOTE
: The calculation will stay the same even in case of option selling.
Fees in Futures Trading (Inverse/USDT Linear Futures)
Usually the trader will only be paying the Taker/Maker fees while opening or closing a position. This fees remains fixed.
Unlike options, the maker fees in Futures is 0.02% less than the taker fees. Hence, a user can take advantage of the less maker fees by ensuring he takes a Maker Order.
Taker Fee: 0.06% of the Notional Size
Maker Fee: 0.04% of the Notional Size
Fee Calculation
Let's assume a trader buys 300 contracts of BTC USDT futures at a price of $26,200.
1 contract of BTC = 0.001 BTC
300 contracts of BTC = 300 * 0.001 = 0.3 BTC
Hence the notional size = 26200 * 0.3 = $7860
Fees for Taker Order will be 0.06% * 7860 =
$4.716
while the
Fees in case it is a Maker Order will be 0.04% * 7860 =
$3.144
NOTE
: The calculation will stay the same even in case of a sell order.

What is the Settlement Fee?
Settlement fees is the fee charged when an open position in a futures or options contract is automatically settled at the expiry of the contract. All settlement trades are processed as taker trades and hence taker fee is applicable.
Futures: Settlement fee is 0.06%
Options: Settlement fee is 0.0375%, capped at 12.5% of premium. The premium cap ensures that options expiring worthless do not incur any settlement fees.
How much trading fees do I need to pay if my option contract expires worthless?
We do not charge any trading fees in case the option contract you were holding expires worthless.
Why are the Options trading fees high compared to Bank-Nifty (India) options?
Crypto options trading fees are slightly higher due to factors like market volatility, liquidity challenges, regulatory considerations, etc. Rest assured, we offer you the best possible rates while ensuring a user-friendly experience."

How can I utilise Delta Cash?
You can utilise Delta Cash for trading in options, futures as well as spot segments.
For example, if you have $25 Delta Cash with you and you’ve made a trade. The trading fees incurred for this trade turns out to be $10. You can now pay the fees in the form of sum of:
$7.5 (from the trading balances you hold) and $2.5 (25% of $10 of Delta Cash you hold).
In a way, you are getting up to 25% discount on your trading fees.
However, if you only have $2 Delta Cash in the above example, you can pay the fees in the form of sum of:
$8 (from the trading balances you hold) and $2 Delta Cash you hold.
How do I know if the fees are being paid with Delta Cash?
You need not worry about whether the fee payment is done via Delta Cash or not. Our system automatically verifies if you have any Delta Cash in your trading account and debits the Delta Cash with a higher preference given to it than your trading balances.

How to use Charting Tools to improve Technical Analysis,"Delta Exchange has integrated Trading View charts that can be used by traders for conducting technical analysis. Here’s the list of features and tools that are at the disposal of traders for enhancing their trading strategies and performance.
1. Multi-Tab Options
The multiple tab option is available on the top of the trading screen interface. The tabs offer different parameters such as traded price, mark price, funding and market dept.
2. Different Chart Types
By default, the chart shown on the interface is a candlestick chart with 15m frequency. However, there are multiple chart options available such as Line, Bars, Hollow Candles and so on, ranging from a frequency of 1 minute to 30 days.
3. Perform Analysis and Technical Studies
This feature on the interface lets traders compare two or more contracts to see if there is any price correlation, draw analysis through data points or track the movement of price. Let’s take, for instance, Bollinger Bands on BTCUSD contract.
Bollinger Bands
is a set of lines plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average. Two standard deviations is not a fixed number and hence traders have the option of changing the standard deviations according to their strategy on the interface. This is what Bollinger Bands on BTCUSD at 1 standard deviation look like.
*The arrow marked in red is where the option to edit charts is available.

After loading a particular study, traders have the option to edit the data points in line with their study.
Please note:
Trading View saves a study in the contract on which the study is created. For example, a trader has created a study on 30 days moving average on BTCUSD. The trader saves the chart as 30MA-BTCUSD. This study is now based on BTCUSD only and
can't be used on another contract
. If the trader then opens ETHUSD chart and opens the moving average study, the BTCUSD contract will also be loaded along with the study. For ETHUSD, a new moving average study needs to be created.
4. Editing Tool
The editing feature lets users choose the tools they are comfortable in using or that help increase the efficiency in making a chart. There are various types of brushes, paint colours, trend lines, a pre-made analysis that traders can load onto their chart. Traders can also add text and can load chart patterns such a Head and Shoulders, Elliot Wave and more.
5. Open charts in full screen or in a new tab
Traders can also view the charts loaded either on the same tab itself, load it on a new window or on full-screen mode. This feature ensures the charts don't clog on one tab itself.
6. Take a Screenshot and Share
Trades can take a screenshot of the charts and indicators they have created, or even wish to share it with other traders or on other platforms."
What is a quanto contract?,"In a typical futures contract, there's a base currency and quote currency. For e.g. in the case of an ETH futures contract that is quoted in USD, ETH is the base currency and USD is the quote currency. The margin and P&L of this contract could be potentially denominated in USD (vanilla futures) or ETH (inverse futures).
Quanto provides a third choice. By using a fixed multiplier the margining and settlement currency can be changed to a third currency. For instance, a BTC-USD multiplier can be defined to create an ETH vanilla quanto that is quoted in USD, but has its margin and P&L denominated in BTC. This is achieved by converting USD values to BTC using a fixed exchange rate provided by the BTC-USD multiplier."
What is an inverse futures contract?,"Consider a futures contract on BTC which is quoted in USD. Here, BTC is the base currency and USD is the quote currency.
In a typical (aka vanilla) futures contract, the margin and profit/ loss are denominated in the quote currency. Thus, a vanila futures on BTC that is quoted in USD is margined and settled in USD.
However, in the case of an inverse contract, margin and profit/ loss are denominated in the base currency. Thus, an inverse futures on BTC that is quoted in USD is margined and settled in BTC."
Sub Accounts: How do they work?,"Sub-accounts are a powerful feature that enable to you to trade through multiple accounts.
Sub-accounts are separate from your ""Main"" account. Each sub-account on Delta Exchange has independent balances, margin and positions and can trade independently. This make sub-accounts helpful in isolating positions, margin or access. Sub-accounts can be used by a single trader to run multiple strategies independently or by a firm with multiple traders, with each trader having its own sub-account.
Sub-account Features
Sub-accounts can be created with or without their own email
Sub-accounts with their own email can be accessed like any other account
Sub-accounts without their own email can be accessed through the Main account or through the sub-account API keys
Each sub-account is independent, in the sense that it has its own balances, deposit addresses, whitelisted withdrawal addresses, API keys and security settings
Sub-accounts inherit the Verification and VIP levels of the Main account
Transfers of balances between sub-accounts are instantaneous and free of charge
Portfolio margin can be enabled only on a single coin per account/ sub-account. By leveraging the sub-accounts feature, portfolio margined positions can be run on multiple coins
The Main account holder has full administrative control over the sub-account. They can enable/ disable 2FA and withdrawals
Note:
Sub accounts cannot claim offers or have trading credits

Paying trading fees in DETO,"DETO can be used for paying fees for trades on Delta Exchange. Please note that this feature is available only to verified users. If you have not yet completed your KYC, you can start the verification process
here
.

There are two other important aspects to paying trading fees in DETO
The DETO that you pay as trading fees will be accepted at a price that is higher of the prevailing market price and the Minimum Support Price (MSP).
MSP
is currently set to $0.10.
For a given trade, only 25% of the trading fees is paid in DETO. The remaining 75% of the trading fees will be paid in the appropriate currency. For example, lets consider a trade which incurs a trading fees of USDT 10. If you have enabled the option of paying trading fees in DETO, you will pay 7.5 USDT and the 2.5 USDT in DETO.
Users in VIP Level 1 or above will not be eligible for paying fees in DETO under MSP program."

How much margin is reserved while placing an order on Delta Exchange?,"When placing an order, margin is reserved for:
Margin for the order
Trading Fees
Order Margin
The margin requirement while placing an order is the
Initial Margin
.
Order Margin = Order Size * Notional Value of 1 contract x Initial Margin%
Initial Margin% can vary from contract to contract and is specified in the
contract specification
.

At Delta we use
margin scaling
which means as order/ position size increases, the margin requirement increases too.

Current Initial Margin% = Initial Margin% + Slope_IM * (Order Size – Order Threshold)
What happens when you already have an open position/orders?
Delta Exchange uses
Isolated Margin System
. Therefore, all open positions have dedicated margin associated with it. But all open orders on a contract share a pool of margin that supports all of them. Due to this:
All orders open in a selected contract are at the
same leverage.
Margin offsetting occurs. All open position and open orders, including the one being placed, are considered. Opposite side position and open orders are netted and the margin for supporting the open position and open orders is computed.
This offsetting reduces the margin requirement considerably.
For example, John places a long order for 100 BTCUSD contracts at 10x leverage. Margin is blocked and the order becomes a position. Now, John places a short order for 100 BTCUSD at 10x leverage. Since John already has an open position in the opposite direction in this contract,
NO margin
is required to place this order.
This is Margin Offsetting.
Trading Fees
When placing an order trading fees are reserved in advance. Depending on the type of order that is executed traders are charged with either Taker Fees or Maker Fees. Reservation of Fees occur when:
An order becomes a position
On closing a position
Therefore with each order, estimated trading fees for opening execution (order becomes a position) and closing execution (position is closed) are reserved. Click here to know more about
Make
and Taker Fees
.
Trading Fees Reserved = (Quantity x Entry_Price x Fee) + (Quantity x Exit_Price x Fee)
*Entry_Price and Exit_Price are estimated using the order characteristics and prevailing prices.

Hence, the margin reserved includes
Order Margin + Trading Fees Reserved."

How are Stop Orders Margined on Delta Exchange?,"When an order is placed on Delta Exchange, margin is blocked for it. This is known as order margin. This means that a trader needs to have sufficient balance in his account to provide margin for an order. In case a trader wishes to place multiple orders, the order margin requirement will be higher, albeit margin offsetting is provided to ensure greater capital efficiency for traders.

The
exception
to this rule is stop orders. While placing a Stop Order,
NO order margin is blocked
. A trader can place multiple stop orders at no additional margin from their account. This helps traders keep multiple stop orders open without having to worry about margin.

Stop orders are conditional orders which result in a market or limit order being sent to the matching engine once the trigger condition has been met. Keeping this nature of stop orders in mind, we look for margin for stop orders only after they have been triggered.

Nevertheless, once the trigger price has been hit, margin is then required for the order. At this point, traders need to ensure they have sufficient balance in their account for the order to be placed. In case, the trader does not have sufficient balance in their account, the stop orders are
CANCELLED
. Many times traders use their entire capital in a single trade without keeping some balance left. During such instances, if by chance, their trigger price has been hit, the stop order will not be placed."
What happens to Open Orders when a Position is liquidated?,"When a position is liquidated on Delta Exchange, all open orders of that contract are
cancelled.
Open Orders and Positions for other contracts are not affected and those orders remain untouched.
Why does this happen?
All Orders on Delta Exchange are traded on Isolated Margin. Isolated Margin is the margin that is dedicated to just a single position irrespective of portfolio margin. Through Isolated Margin, the most a trader can lose in a trade is the margin put up for that trade only.
Click here
to know more about Isolated Margin.
Similarly, all open orders too have dedicated margin. But to keep margin requirement low or improve capital usage efficiency for traders, we provide margin offsetting. If a trader places an order which will close an open position, no margin is charged for it.

While closing a position, the margin requirement for the open orders on that contract may change because some of the benefits of margin offsetting may go away. Delta can potentially do one of the three things:
Draw more margin from the trader’s available balance to support the new margin requirement.
Cancel some of the open orders to reduce the margin requirement.
Cancel all the open orders.
We have chosen the third option because we don’t want to make decisions on behalf of traders.
A scenario of a position getting liquidated and all Open Orders being cancelled
Bob has entered into a long position on BTCUSD at $8000 using 50x leverage. The liquidation price for this position is $7882. The price has fallen to $7881 and Liquidation Engine has taken over the position and tries to close the position at the best price possible.

At this point, if Bob has placed multiple open orders on BTCUSD, those open order will be cancelled. Thus, even though Bob has placed an open buy order at $7880 in the order books, the order will be cancelled due to liquidation.
The reason Open Orders on other contracts is not cancelled is that on Delta Exchange traders use
Isolated Margin instead of Cross Margin."
"Time in Force Flags on Delta Exchange – IOC, GTC","Time in Force Flags provides traders with a way to create specific behaviour of orders for a more sophisticated trading strategy. These types of orders are useful in the way, that they are another tool you can use to help manage risk, maximise returns and minimise losses.
Click here
to know more about the different order types on Delta Exchange.
Time in Force Flags
Time in Force is a special instruction used to indicate how long will an order remain active for before it is executed or cancelled. This gives a trader the mechanism of controlling time for a particular trade.

Below are the 3 different types of TIF Flags on Delta Exchange:
Immediate or Cancel
An Immediate or Cancel (IOC) Order is an order that is executed immediately. If there is partial execution, the unfilled portion of the order is cancelled immediately. This guarantees immediate execution at the specified limit price or better. In case the order cannot be fulfilled the Limit IOC Order is then cancelled.

IOC orders are always executed as taker orders and hence incur taker fees.
When to use IOC
Traders usually use Limit IOC when they want to acquire or load off shares within a price range. In essence, Limit IOC is a combination of a Limit Order and Market Order.

While closing a position from the positions tab, the Limit IOC option is available.

to know more.
Good till Cancelled
A Good till Cancelled Order or a GTC order is an open order till it is either executed or cancelled by the trader. If there is partial execution of an order, the remaining quantity is open till the order is either executed or cancelled. All Limit Orders on Delta Exchange are by default a GTC order

GTC orders may get executed either as a taker or maker order. To ensure that a GTC order is executed as a maker order, you can make it
post-only.
When to use GTC
Traders usually place a GTC order when they want to buy below the current market price or want to sell above the current market price. Usually, when a trader is not too particular on the trade being executed immediately, a trader will place GTC as there is uncertainty when the entire order will be fulfilled based on price and quantity."
Understanding Contract Symbols on Delta Exchange,"On Delta Exchange, the contracts are abbreviated in a specific format.
If Any
>
If Any
>
If a trader can understand and decode contract symbols, they can then interpret other contract symbols without putting in too much time and effort.
The first 3/4 letters are the underlying asset that is being traded.
The latter 3/4 letters are the quote currency.
In the case of a single letter (Q) added post the quote currency, the letter represents the type of currency product.
The last details in a contract would be the date, in case the contract expires on a particular date.
You can’t figure out whether a contract is inverse or vanilla from the symbology. You need to know what is the margining/ settlement currency too, in addition to the contract symbol.

How to Close an Open Position on Delta Exchange,"There are two ways on how to exit an Open Position
Place an order of the same size and the opposite direction.
Close the position from the Positions widget
Closing a position from the Position Widget
Once an order has been placed, the tab of open positions shows all the details of the order that has been placed. In the Positions widget, you will see the net amount of contracts you are long or short, quantity in each contract, entry price, and liquidation price and so on.
To the extreme right is the option of ‘Close Position’. A trader can choose between two options while closing an order:
Market Order
Limit IOC
Market Order is closing the position at the best available price. The greatest advantage of a market order is that the order will be immediately filled if there is enough liquidity in the order book.But execution price is not guaranteed and if position size is large relative to liquidity in the order book, you may incur slippages.

Limit IOC stands for Immediate or Cancel. A limit IOC order can be executed partially or fully based on the available quantity, and the remaining lot is cancelled immediately. From the order book screenshot below, a trader wishes to buy 10,000 contracts at $9379.However, only 9901 are available at the price. Thus, the trader receives 9901 contracts are the remaining are cancelled. Click here to know more on Limit IOC orders.
Closing a position fully or partially
Once the trader has decided which type of order he wants to place, the trader then needs to decide the quantity of the contracts. The trader can wish to close the entire position or a part of it. Delta Exchange offers an inbuilt calculation which provides the option of closing 25%, 50% 75% or the entire 100% of your open position.
Open Orders may get cancelled
Delta Exchange offers Order Offsetting for open positions and open orders. Once a position is closed, open orders may require additional margin. In case, additional margin is not available for these open orders once the position is closed, the open orders are cancelled. Click here to know more on Order Offsetting.

Summary of changes made to funding mechanism for perpetual contracts,"We have recently made a few important changes to the mechanics of funding rate for perpetual contracts. While the
user guide
has been updated and has full details of how funding works, we are highlighting the changes that have been made here.
The formula used to compute funding has been changed
The new formula for funding rate is:
Funding Rate = Avg Premium + clamp (Interest Rate - Avg Premium, 0.05%, -0.05%)
where, Avg Premium is the 8-hour TWAP of the contract's premium (i.e. % difference of the contract's mark price and the underlying index price) and Interest Rate is the differential of borrow rates of the quoting currency and base currency.

As of now, Interest Rate for all contract is set to 0.01%/ 8h.

After this change, our funding computation formula is in line with the industry. Further, the use of clamp function helps to keep the magnitude of funding low. For e.g. when Avg Premium varies from (-0.04%, 0.06%), the funding rate will stay flat at 0.01%.
Funding now changes once every 8 hours
Previously, funding rate was computed every minute. Thus, funding rate could potentially change every minute. Now, funding is computed once every 8 hours. So, funding rate stays flat for 8 hours. Again, this is in line with the well accepted industry practices.

The lesser fluctuation/ greater certainty in funding rates will also enable traders to run long/ short strategies for perpetual/ futures and perpetual/ spot pair trades more profitably.
Funding is still exchanged every minute
This is where we are different from many of our peers. On most derivative exchanges, funding is exchanged between longs/ shorts once every 8 hours. On Delta Exchange, this exchange of funding is a continuous process that happens once every minute.This means as long as you are in a position, you are always either receiving funding or paying funding.
Funding Caps are lower
In response to demand from our traders, we have made funding caps tighter for most contracts. With the exception of a few contracts, funding caps for perpetual contracts are now set at 0.1%/ 8h.

You can find the funding cap for a contract in its
specifications
.
Impact sizes are lower
We have also lowered impact sizes for most contracts, bringing them in line with market accepted practices. The impact size for a contract is pertinent to computation of mark price and hence, computation of the funding rate.

You can find the impact size for a contract in its
specifications
."
Are there any limits on funding?,"Yes, the maximum value of funding rate at any instant (regardless of the sign) is capped. This 'Funding Cap' can vary from contract to contract and is available on the
contract specifications page."
How can I see the history of funding for any contract?,You can see the funding rate history for a selected perpetual contract by selecting the ‘Funding’ tab in the chart.
What is funding?,"A perpetual contract is designed to trade close to spot. Funding is the mechanism which helps to achieve this. It is a series of continuous payments that are exchanged between longs and shorts in a perpetual contract.

When a perpetual contract is trading at a premium to spot, funding is positive and longs pay shorts. This creates a downward pressure on the contract's price. Conversely, when a perpetual contract is trading at a discount to spot, funding is negative and shorts pay longs. In this situation, there is an upward pressure on the contract's price.

It is important to note that funding payments are completely peer to peer. Delta Exchange does not charge any fees on funding payments.
